## What is Phiz?
Phiz is a tool that allows you to perform facial motion capture from any device and location. It seamlessly integrate it into your preferred virtual production software with minimal setup and low latency.

## TLDR. Just show me how to use it.
Phiz consists of a website, a desktop app, and custom plugins for common game engines and 3D softwares.

1. Download and install the windows/macOS/linux executable files from release page.
2. Go to the [website](https://phizmocap.dev) on your device you planned to record with.
3. Copy the link from the website and paste it into the desktop app. If the connection is successful, you should see data being received in the desktop app.
4. Check out the plugin session to setup your choice of virtual production software.

## How does it work?
The website allows users to capture facial motion data using their browser without the need for a server. The data is then transmitted via a peer-to-peer connection between the website and the desktop app, and is broadcast locally so that it can be used with the custom plugins for virtual production tools.
